## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What a caching system is
* What FIFO means
* What LIFO means
* What LRU means
* What MRU means
* What LFU means
* What the purpose of a caching system
* What limits a caching system have

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* All your files will be `interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)`
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## More Info
### Parent class `BaseCaching`
All your classes must inherit from `BaseCaching` defined below:
```
$ cat base_caching.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" BaseCaching module
"""

class BaseCaching():
    """ BaseCaching defines:
      - constants of your caching system
      - where your data are stored (in a dictionary)
    """
    MAX_ITEMS = 4

    def __init__(self):
        """ Initiliaze
        """
        self.cache_data = {}

    def print_cache(self):
        """ Print the cache
        """
        print("Current cache:")
        for key in sorted(self.cache_data.keys()):
            print("{}: {}".format(key, self.cache_data.get(key)))

    def put(self, key, item):
        """ Add an item in the cache
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("put must be implemented in your cache class")

    def get(self, key):
        """ Get an item by key
        """
        raise NotImplementedError("get must be implemented in your cache class")
```

## Tasks

+ [x] 0. **Basic dictionary**<br/>[0-basic_cache.py](0-basic_cache.py) contains a Python class `BasicCache` that inherits from [`BaseCaching`](base_caching.py) and is a caching system:
  + You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class [`BaseCaching`](base_caching.py).
  + This caching system doesn't have limit.
  + `def put(self, key, item):`:
    + Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    + If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
  + `def get(self, key):`:
    + Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    + If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn't exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`.

  + You must use `self.cache_data` - dictionary from the parent class [`BaseCaching`](base_caching.py).
  + You can overload `def __init__(self):` but don't forget to call the parent init: `super().__init__()`.
  + `def put(self, key, item):`:
    + Must assign to the dictionary `self.cache_data` the `item` value for the key `key`.
    + If `key` or `item` is `None`, this method should not do anything.
    + If the number of items in `self.cache_data` is higher than `BaseCaching.MAX_ITEMS`:
      + You must discard the first item put in cache (FIFO algorithm).
      + You must print `DISCARD: ` with the key discarded and following by a new line.
  + `def get(self, key):`:
    + Must return the value in `self.cache_data` linked to `key`.
    + If `key` is `None` or if the `key` doesn't exist in `self.cache_data`, return `None`.
